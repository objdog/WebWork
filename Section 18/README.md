#jQuery Lecture notes
##What is jQuery
A DOM manipulation library. (Write less, do more)
It helps us manipulate the DOM.
--
jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich javascript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility. jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write javascript.

It can help us select, manipulate, and create elements. Add event listeners, animate elements, add effects and make HTTP requests(AJAX)

##What is a library
The core idea is to take code that someone else wrote and include it in our code.

A single file with a bunch of methods and properties in it that we can use.
##Why would you use jQuery
It fixes "broken" DOM API. Historically developers considered the built in API to be broken.

It clarifies your code and makes it shorter. It's easy to use and supports multiple browsers.
Built in AJAX support.
Lots of folks use it so it can't suck right? There's a big community out there and tons of places to find resources to help the developer.
##Why would you not use jQuery
The DOM API isn't really broken anymore. It has been continuously developed and improved.

It doesn't do anything that you can't do without it. It can be an unnecessary dependency depending on what your application is.

It can impact performance.

Lots of people are moving away from jQuery... so the community might get smaller and more dated.

## Colt's thoughts:
He used to teach DOM manipulation exclusively through the context of jQuery. Over time he had more and more students come to him and tell him that their employers weren't using jQuery and that they had to quickly figure out how to do the same tasks in 'vanilla' JavaScript.

So he changed his method and started teaching 'vanilla' first, and then moving into jQuery. He noticed that his students seemed to have a better understanding of DOM manipulation theory.
